I am a pre-final year student at Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee in the Electrical Engineering Department. I was a mentee under Microsoft Engage Mentorship Program'21 where we worked on this year project under Microsoft Experts.<br>
My current obsession is learning about new technologies! Reading and Painting are my other pastimes. I also love connecting with new people.
